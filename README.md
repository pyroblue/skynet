Skynet- a Global Digital Defense Network
======
This is the primary repository for the Node.js application given command over all computerized military hardware and systems, including the B-2 stealth bomber fleet and America's entire nuclear weapons arsenal. The strategy behind Skynet's creation is to remove the possibility of human error and slow reaction time to guarantee a fast, efficient response to enemy attack.
